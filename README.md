House Price Prediction with Linear Regression
This project uses a linear regression model to predict house prices based on specific features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The goal is to explore a simple predictive model and evaluate its performance.

Project Structure
Dataset: The project uses a house price dataset (e.g., train.csv) that includes various house attributes along with their sale prices.
Model Training: A linear regression model is trained using selected features to predict the sale price.
Evaluation: The model’s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.


Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Install required libraries with:


pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Usage
Load and Preprocess Data: Load the dataset, select relevant features, and handle any missing values.
Train the Model: Train a linear regression model on the selected features.
Evaluate the Model: Use the test set to evaluate model performance and visualize the results.


Results
The linear regression model achieves the following performance on the test data:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): value
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): value
R² Score: value
These metrics can be used to assess the accuracy of the model and guide improvements.
